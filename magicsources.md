What is magic anyways? Where does it come from? What is it all about?

    Spells are just technology from a long-dead civilization. 
    Spells are what happens when spirits show up in the physical world. Ghosts, demons, spells--all the same.
    Magic occurs when your soul leaves your body to go do other stuff. Counterspells are dark magic that directly erases the soul.
    The universe is actively anti-inductive. A previous civilization figured out the laws of physics, which made the laws of physics change. 
    Inter-dimensional aliens are doing science. Spells are experimental tech, and the aliens are having expendable lower-life forms run the safety tests.
     Magic is a hoax. Doesn't actually exist. It's all just mirrors and bits of twine.

    The laws of physics are a government cover-up. Anyone can do magic if they stop eating the fluoridated ham.
    People learned magic by studying the abilities of the ancient titans which roam the land. Pyromancy was learned from the father of dragons. Divination is a gift from the Moonwatcher. Necromancy comes from the Corpse Ball over in Glasmont.
    Magic comes from the power of emotion! Specifically, an emotion that most people can't feel anymore. Ancient sages trapped the emotion in a bottle and distilled it into a more concentrated form.
    Chunks of another reality that fell through the holes in the sky (the stars) and warp the world around them. You can carry around little slivers of these other worlds and throw them at people.
    Magic comes from Fighting Spirit! Scream loudly and passionately! Wizards train to scream in the most passionate manner.
    Magic comes from meditation and attunement with the universe.

    The universe is a dream, and if you think in ways similarly to the dreamer, you can exercise some control over the dream.
    The universe is a simulation. Due to a security flaw, you can send commands to some subroutines you weren't supposed to be able to access.
    Nanomachines, son!
    God just really likes certain sounds and gestures. Spells are divine applause.
    The universe used to be chaos, filled with the unlimited force of creation. From this chaos, many worlds were born. Ones in which the force of creation was limited tended to be more stable. But entirely constrained universes can't use the force of creation to create new universes. So there is a selective advantage for worlds just unstable enough to support the creation of child demiplanes. The anthropic principle does the rest. 
    At the start of time, magic was limitless and birthed the universe. Any time magic becomes degenerate enough to cause an extinction event, it becomes more limited. Eventually, only the magic of gravity will remain.

     It's all a coincidence. Particles can, with very low probability, spontaneously rearrange due to quantum tomfoolery. You just happen to live in one of the vanishingly rare Everett branches where magic coincidentally seems to work. Chants and finger-wiggles correlate with the spontaneous appearance of fireballs. There's no reason for it to continue working tomorrow, though.
    That's not magic. It's just a very elaborate form of camouflage for insects.
    It's an allergic reaction to certain foods.
    Every living creature has a little bit of magic in its soul. If you staple enough souls onto your own, then your soul becomes strong enough to control reality.
    You get magic by stealing power from your alternate-universe selves.
    Only animals have access to magic powers. In order to cast a fireball, you need a pet fire toad.

    It just comes out of big holes in the ground. 
    Mana is the byproduct of normal metabolic processes.  Air+water+light->sugar+magic+better air
    Dragons radiate it. Mana is dragon waste. Some creatures have evolved to collect this waste and reuse it to open doors or clean their clothes.
    Lightning supercharges matter with mana.
    Blood is liquid magic. More blood = more wizard powers. The gods have severe hypertension.
    That's not magic. It's a tumor.

    The universe is a simulation. Magic is just a hacked together solution to some universe-crashing bug, and will be removed in a future update.
    There are multiple competing gods, who disagree about the laws of physics and try to change things when they think the other gods aren't looking.
    Gods are playing hyperchess with people as the pieces. Magic is given to the important players.
    Listen. There  was this talking bird who crashed into a psychic ocean monster, but he was so good at video games that he was able to take over the monsters brain and then used his new psychic powers to transform himself into a spaceship and fly around the stars but then he got into a fight with a big robot crab and the robot crab pushed him into a black hole but instead of getting squished he became omnipotent. So anyways when magic happens, it's the bird guy. 
    Gold. Gold is where magic comes from.
    The real magic was the friends we made along the way.

Every living creature has a little bit of magic in its soul. If you staple enough souls onto your own, then your soul becomes strong enough to control reality.









Magic is metaphysical in nature.
1. Magic is what happens when parallel universes slam into each other. You get magic by stealing power from your alternate-universe selves.
2. The universe is actively anti-inductive. A previous civilization figured out the laws of physics, which made the laws of physics change to become weirder. 
3. The cosmos used to be chaos, filled with the unlimited force of creation. From this chaos, many universes were born. Ones in which the force of creation was limited tended to be more stable. But entirely constrained universes can't use the force of creation to create new universes. So there is a selective advantage for worlds just unstable enough to support the creation of child demiplanes. The anthropic principle does the rest. 
4. Magic is just the leftover scraps of physics that haven't been banned. At the start of time, magic was limitless and birthed the universe. Any time magic becomes degenerate enough to cause an extinction event, it becomes more limited. Eventually, only the magic of magical exclusion itself will remain.
5. Chunks of another reality fell through the holes in the sky (the stars) and warp the world around them. Mages carry around little slivers of these other worlds and throw them at people.
6. The laws of physics are a government cover-up. Anyone can do magic if they stop eating the fluoridated ham.



Magic comes from the divine.
1. There are multiple competing gods, who disagree about the laws of physics and try to change things when they think the other gods aren't looking.
2. Gods are playing hyperchess with people as the pieces. Magic is given to the important players.
3. God just really likes certain sounds and gestures. Spells are divine applause.
4. Spells are what happens when spirits show up in the physical world. Ghosts, demons, spells--all the same.
5. The universe is a dream, and if you think in ways similarly to the dreamer, you can exercise some control over the dream.
6. Magic is the divine. Not a manifestation of the will of the gods, but the actual physical form of the gods.



Magic comes from the self.
1. Magic comes from meditation and attunement with the universe.
2. Magic comes from the power of emotion! Specifically, an emotion that most people can't feel anymore. Ancient sages trapped the emotion in a bottle and distilled it into a more concentrated form.
3. Magic comes from Fighting Spirit! Scream loudly and passionately! Wizards train to scream in the most passionate manner.
4. Blood is liquid magic. More blood = more wizard powers. The gods have severe hypertension.
5. Magic occurs when your soul leaves your body to go do other stuff. Counterspells are dark magic that directly erases the soul.
6. Mana is the byproduct of normal metabolic processes. Plants transform stale air, water, and light into fresh air, sugar, and magic. Wizards transform fresh air, sugar, and magic into stale air and bad decisions.

Magic comes from technology.
1. The universe is a simulation. Magic is just a hacked together solution to some universe-crashing bug, and will be removed in a future update.
2. Spells are just technology from a long-dead civilization. 
2. The universe is a simulation. Due to a security flaw, you can send commands to some subroutines you weren't supposed to be able to access.

You are mistaken about magic.
1. Magic is a hoax. Doesn't actually exist. It's all just mirrors and bits of twine. 
2. That's not magic. It's just a very elaborate form of camouflage for insects.
3. It's all a coincidence. Particles can, with very low probability, spontaneously rearrange due to quantum tomfoolery. You just happen to live in one of the vanishingly rare Everett branches where magic coincidentally seems to work. Chants and finger-wiggles correlate with the spontaneous appearance of fireballs.
