Once in an eon, the heat settles down into the danger zone and vast oceans of stew start to spoil.
Is this actually a parody setting? Or is it just the canonical Planescape described by  a very hungry and confused planewalker? I'll never tell.

(There's already plenty of grumbling about their experiment-crazy neighbors over in the Test Kitchens)

Buildings stocked with quickly prepared fried food, and reheated mass-produced meals seem to just sprout out of the ground here. A paradise for drive-thru warriors. An endless 

Drive-thru warriors on this plane sup on endless soda and greasy meat pillaged from the fast-food joints that sprout like weeds from these shifting lands. But such greasy ill-gotten goods cannot provide all that the body needs. It is only through the magic of this plane that the souls here are kept in fighting condition.

<br />
In the original Planescape setting, the Inner Planes are worlds each comprised of some pure material element.<br />
<br />
In Platescape, the Inner Plates are each comprised of some pure food group. <a href="http://paperelemental.blogspot.com/2018/07/campaign-setting-platescape-inner.html">You can read more about that here.</a><br />
<br />
In Planescape, there's also a great wheel of Outer Planes, corresponding to the standard D&amp;D alignments of Good vs. Evil and Lawful vs. Chaotic.<br />
<br />
In Platescape, the Outer Plates correspond to the different kinds of dining experiences.<br />
<br />
On one axis, we have Delicious vs. Repulsive. Delicious cuisine aims to evoke gustatory pleasure, satisfying the desires of the diner. Repulsive cuisine eschews these desires as irrelevant, or actively seeks to create an unpleasant dining experience.<br />
<br />
On the other axis, we have Healthy vs. Unhealthy. Healthy cuisine aims to provide the diner with the optimal profile of macro and micronutrients. Unhealthy doesn't give a hoot.<br />

<h2>
<!--more--></h2><h1 style="text-align: left;">Upper Plates of Culinary Excellence</h1>
The Upper Plates are aligned with the raw forces of deliciousness. These are the realms of the gods of cookery, and the place where foodies aspire to have their souls reside in the afterlife.<br /><br /><br /><br />
<h3>
The .&nbsp;</h3>
(<i><i>Delicious and </i>Healthy</i>)&nbsp; -&nbsp; Taste tasting, experimentation? Twin worlds. Nutrition by virtue of variety.<br />
<br /><br /><br /><h3>The Test Kitchens.&nbsp;</h3>
(<i><i>Delicious and Reasonably </i>Healthy</i>)&nbsp; -&nbsp; Twin worlds, vertically mirrored, like a cosmic sandwich. Look up from the ground of one and you will see the farms, roads, and restaurants of the other far above.<br />
<br />
The two worlds are similar but never exactly the same. The gods use these worlds for A/B testing of new culinary creations. Not just new dishes, but also the meats of new animals, and the raw forms of new vegetables. The resulting food is frequent bizarre, but almost always delicious, as constant experimentation slowly meanders towards perfection.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The great work of this plate is unconcerned with the question of healthiness, but the sheer variety of food means that a participant will consume a balanced-enough diet.<br />
<br />
The angels of this world are constantly rushing from one place to the next, trying new things. None of that eternal vigilant guardian business.<div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /><h3>Grillysium </h3>
(<i><i>Pure Delicious</i></i>)&nbsp; - An island covered with deliciousness of all sorts. Everything is edible, and even the blades of grass are subtle delicacies. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y8aYd9uqFY">If you want to view paradise...&nbsp;</a><br />
<br />Near the edges of&nbsp;Grillysium, the food is merely excellent, but as you journey away from the shores, the food gets ever better. Be careful, lest you accidentally taste a drop of heavenly dew and be rendered forever numb to the sensations of mortal dining.<div><br /></div><div>At the very center of the island, where even the air is a culinary masterpiece, and surrounded by blissed out disciples, sits the God of Pilgrimage. For as long as any living being can recall, this diety has remained in silent meditation.<br />
<br />
This may seem odd, that a god of pilgrimage would never move, but its followers explain things like so:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The God of Pilgrimage&nbsp;judges the merit of any restaurant they visit, and awards stars to truly exceptional locations. One star indicates that a location is worth the stop, two stars indicates that it is worth a detour. Three stars is worth a special journey. And four stars is worth an eternal meditation on the quality of the meal. </blockquote>
<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fy6t0FN8eSQ/XpYodHhtMSI/AAAAAAAAA1U/RvUET1VwH7I8-XTZbvlmkyPOHoyv3egBgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/michelin%2Bmeditate%2B4%2Bstar.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="700" data-original-width="769" height="363" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fy6t0FN8eSQ/XpYodHhtMSI/AAAAAAAAA1U/RvUET1VwH7I8-XTZbvlmkyPOHoyv3egBgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/michelin%2Bmeditate%2B4%2Bstar.png" width="400" /></a></div>
The cult is divided on whether the deity has already eaten. Some claim that the moment of creation featured the perfect meal, of which all other meals are an imperfect echo. While some others believe that the deity is sitting in wait for the Test Kitchens to complete their eternal experimentation and deliver a worthy meal to the center of Grillysium.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>
<h3>
The Hungry Hunting Grounds.&nbsp;</h3>
(<i><i>Delicious and </i>Moderately Unhealthy</i>)&nbsp; -&nbsp; Animals run wild, fatty and laden with meat. Eternal hunts and grand bonfire feasts.<br />
<br />
Despite having the appearance of a vast forest, this realm is connected to the elemental plate of meat. None of the plants are more than technically edible, and I think some of the trees might even be fake...<br />
<br />
A word of warning to any visitors who wish to hunt here: You too are made of meat. <br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
<div>
<h3>
<b>Party Mountain</b>&nbsp;</h3>
(<i><i>Delicious but </i>Unhealthy </i>) - Fried food, giant pizzas, all sorts of crazy divine party drugs. This is where the Greek pantheon likes to hang out.<br />
<br />
But seriously, be careful if some crazy-looking goatman offers you "Fairy Bread". They'll claim it's some of that stuff from Grillysium which is so delicious that it will make mortal food seem like but a shadow. But I'm pretty sure it's just opium. Like, 95% sure, if it's a goatman offering you the stuff.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">——===&nbsp;🍳 ===——</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>

Lower Plates of Dining Disasters</h1>
The Lower Plates are aligned with Nastiness. Herein lie all manner of horrific culinary sins and dietary tragedies. Beware, dear reader, for these ...</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /><h3><b>Super-food Hell</b>&nbsp;</h3>
(<i>Healthy but Repulsive</i>) - Ruled over by the 9 Princes of Hell's Kitchens, each with their own fad diet.&nbsp; One region is a jungle of wheatgrass and durians. In another, vast fields of larva are tended to by devilish farmers (great source of protein). Devils force-feed their masters' newest inventions to poor lost souls. Every meal follows the laws of nutrition but gleefully rejects every other principle of fine dining.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Burnt food (<i>Repulsive and Only Slightly Healthy</i>) - Four giant cooking pots floating through the void.The Yugoloths here<br />
<br />
&nbsp;A plate in which proper food preparation is impossible. Huge The giant volcanoes in this world create such intense heat that it's impossible to cook any food without burning it. Even fresh produce somehow chars when taken to this realm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>The Compost Bin</b></h3>
(<i>Neutral Respulsive</i>) - Bleak plains full of sickly vegetation. This plate is a major battleground for the forces of nastiness. The princes of hell want to search the land for new disgusting super-foods, while the devils want to scour the land for exotic poisons.<br />
<br />

Poorly Run Restaurants<br />

<b>Cosmic Supermax</b>&nbsp;</h3>
(<i>Repulsive and Somewhat Unhealthy</i>) - A prison world where the only food is the kind fed to the imprisoned and neglected: foul tasting and barely nutritious. The ancient titans here ate their own shoes long ago.<br />
<br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>

<h3>
<b>The Abyss&nbsp;</b></h3>
<i>(Unhealthy and Respulsive)</i> - A nightmare realm that represents the active opposition to all that makes food worthwhile.<br />

Demons swarm this world like locusts, devouring everything edible and most things that aren't.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>And count yourself lucky if you never see the inside of an abyssal restaurant. Patrons rarely survive the experience, but I've heard tales. Oh, I've heard tales. I once met a poor half-shredded spirit with shattered teeth. He told me a horrible story of how the demons force-fed him pebbles, and whenever he failed to chew properly, they would shave off a piece of his soul and force him to eat that too.</div><div><br />

<h3>
A Note on Demons Vs. Devils. </h3>
Many casual observers can't tell the difference between Demons and Devils. After all, they're both great hairy, scaly, slobbery beasts, with bulging eyes, wearing ill-fitting aprons. But while the appearances may be similar, their minds and motivations couldn't be more different.<br />
<br />See, devils have just lost sight of part of the picture. They're obsessed with healthfulness to such an extreme that they don't just neglect flavor, but actively scorn it as a shameful distraction. But fundamentally, a Devil Chef is still trying to make something that can reasonable be called food.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, demons, on the other hand. Those dreadful things are what you get when you take every instinct towards pleasure, towards healthy living, and towards artistic accomplishment, and flip it on its head. A demon only cares about food because they <i>hate</i> knowing that there are people out there in the cosmos enjoying their meals. They <i>hate</i> the thought of a being improving it's lot in life through good nutrition. It repulses them on a deep instinctual level, in much the same way you're repulsed by a festering maggot-ridden corpse. (A demon is also repulsed by such a thing, but only because the maggots are enjoying themselves.) And a motivated demon only learns to cook so they can subvert the process, invert it, and produce a negaculinary masterpiece so repulsive and vile that it makes a witness swear off the whole idea of food in the first place.</div><div><br /></div><div>Why do the gods tolerate the existence of such vile creatures? Well that's simple, it's because of all the beings in the cosmos offended by the existence of demons, devils are offended most of all. Without the infinite hordes of the abyss to war against and/or lecture about nutrition, the Princes of Hell might break in the vaults of heaven and try feed a kale smoothie to Metatron.<br /><br />

Neutral Ground</h3>
(<i>Pure Unhealthy</i>) - Mortal dining establishments rarely reach a level of pure experience comparable to what can be found along the edges of the Great Smörgåsbord. Within the interior, things are much less extreme, and not too dissimilar to what can be found on the material planes.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But something strange begins to happen as you near the very center of the Smörgåsbord. Food becomes remarkable in its unremarkability. It's not that the hot dogs sold in the hot dog stands of this vast transdimensional plate are <i>bland</i>.&nbsp; It's just that they're not... <i>not bland</i>.<br />
<br />
And then at all once, right in the center of it all, things become remarkable yet again. Atop an infinitely high skewer of slightly overdone doner kebab, sits the smoky cookoff capital of the cosmos: the great city of Everything Bagel! And therein dwells its ruler and head judge, the most powerful chef in the cosmos, the Lady of Propane.</div><div><br />

<h4>
Note:</h4><div>Is this actually a parody setting? Or is it just the canonical Planescape described by&nbsp; a very hungry and confused planewalker? I'll never tell.</div><div><br /></div>
The classic elemental planes are a bit too uniform for my taste, and don't make good locations for the kinds of adventures I like to run, so in designing the <a href="http://paperelemental.blogspot.com/2018/07/campaign-setting-platescape-inner.html">Elemental Plates,</a> I maintained only a loose conceptual link to the originals.<br />
<br />
But the Outer Planes of Planescape are already a really interesting and gameable setting. So for these, I've essentially taken the original Great Wheel and just put a chef's hat on everything. In fact, I am amused by the thought that there is no "Great Smörgåsbord", and that all of the above is just the canonical Planescape Great Wheel, as described by a very hungry planewalker.<br />
